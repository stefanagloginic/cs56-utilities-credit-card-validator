a) This project generates credit card numbers for varying card types, Mastercard, Visa, American Express, and Discover. It uses the GUI interface which displays to the user a line to input their card number as well as a scroll bar to enter the type of card it is, and validate it.

b) As a user, I can validate my card number so that I can ensure my card is genuine.
   As a user, I can generate random cards of varying types so that I can see a valid card type.
   As a user, I can validate other's card numbers so that I can ensure it is genuine. 

c) The software runs. It utilizes x11 to display to the user an enter line which takes in the credit card number of the user and validates it, as well as a scroll bar with the varying types of cards. The user can select the type of card and then check if it is valid. The user can also generate their own card number.

c) Perhaps we could make a fake account with a login and password that displays the current amount in the account and allows for fake deposits or withdrawls. This could perhaps make the interaction with the software more fun and allow for some interesting functionality other than a button being clicked and a string coming out. Instead in this case the button is clicked and a new page is opened.

d) The README.md file could have more context as to how the program works instead of just its functionality and the interface it uses so that maintenence is made easier.

e) The build.xml file needs removal of the jws and publish targets because they are no longer necessary. We are unsure of what the download directory does, it might need cleanup but we would need to investigate further into the matter. 

f) The current standing "issues" that were brought up were bringing up asteriks to privatize personal information when typing card numbers into the enter line. The other issue brought up involved allowing the generation of more than one card. And the last issue involved making the software more aesthetically pleasing by integrating the use of bootstrap and converting the GUI to HTML. This sums for a total of 800 points so there aren't enough issue points to work with for the time being. The issues are clear to demonstrate the expectations for this project.

g)We do not have any additional issues to offer. Perhaps some revisement of the code could be done (for example there was a double cast from a character to an int and back to a character in the code for a char array for the CCValidator class). There was one glaring thing to be observed in that all the methods for the credit cards were repetitive (ex: utilizing the luhns sum algorithm with no distinction between them) thereby showing for good application for inheritance. The methods were very long and convoluted for what should be one simpler function, interaction between methods is almost negligible in these classes.

h) There are some areas of ambiguity with the code. There were not enough comments in order to discern the purpose of some lines of the code, (ex: user runs through array and multiplies even numbers by two and odd by one, although not mentioning that they were following the luhn's algorithm for randomizing card numbers.) However, the variable names of the code added clarity to the purpose underlying the variables. The code was organized well, each card type had its own class as well as the validation. Each class had a constructor which created a unique card number. Comments were provided for what defined that specific card type (ex: all visa cards start with a 4). The usage of classes imported added to the overall purpose of some checks or alterations in arrays, and the methods function were concise in the purpose they served. However, the methods could have been cleaner and some of the code could have been inherited from a upper class, perhaps just Card.class. Helper functions could also have been inherited from a superclass and thereby added to the efficiency and clarity of the code. If a programmer were to require a brief "screenfull of text", I would say: This code serves the purpose of introducing a GUI interface which generates as well as validates many varying credit card types. The GUI relies on a series of buttons for the card types as well as a generate and validate button. It also includes a drop down menu with the card types. When the card type is input and checked for validation one of two strings appears from the given options "card type invalid" or "card type valid". Each card type comes with their own class to create valid yet randomized numbers for the specific type of card. (ex: visa card always starts with 4, but can have 44 or 47). There is also a seperate class for the validation, which reverses the randomization process so it can check the last digit of the card).

i) In regard to the test coverage, only the CCValidator was tested. It was not even extensively tested. It only checked if the input from the user is acceptable in terms for the array. However we noticed that there weren't any checks for the varying cards as well as the interaction between the cards and the validate/generate methods. We would probably expand test coverage to incorporate tests for the credit cards and their validate/generate methods.
